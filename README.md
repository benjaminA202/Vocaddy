As an enthusiastic and hardworking developer, I embarked on a journey to learn how to code and put my skills to the test. In the course of my learning, I created a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that reflects my passion for creating innovative solutions.

Although I had the option to create a simple TicTacToe website, I decided to invest my time in something more meaningful that had the potential to generate revenue. I took on the challenge of designing the entire user interface and design elements from scratch.

I utilized my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the app responsive on 95% of Chrome Browser Screen Sizes. Leveraging my experience with JavaScript frameworks, I utilized ExpressJS for the backend. 

As the PWA required user authentication and authorization, I integrated the Auth0 stack to provide robust and secure authentication features. I also implemented Paddle for payment processing, Designed ads, and researched relevant keywords to optimize the PWA's commercial viability.

While working on the project, I encountered some obstacles, such as the need to modularize my code and implement other best practices. However, I approached these hurdles with a tenacious attitude and an unwavering attention to detail. As a result, the PWA, although not perfect, is a testament to my drive to push myself and continually improve.

I came to the conclusion that the project did not have product market fit and might not be a profitable venture. Nevertheless, I have learned valuable lessons from this experience that I carry with me to this day.

As a developer, I am committed to producing high-quality code that is scalable and easy to read. I analyze mistakes made in previous projects to ensure that I continually improve and deliver optimal results. I believe that my dedication to excellence and my unwavering work ethic make me a great hire for any organization looking for a skilled and motivated developer.
